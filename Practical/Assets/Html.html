    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

    Hypertext refers to the way web pages are organized, with text that can be linked to other pages or resources. This allows users to navigate between related pages on the web by clicking on hyperlinks.
    Markup Language refers to the way HTML documents are formatted using tags and attributes that define the structure and content of the page. HTML tags are used to specify different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and tables, while attributes provide additional information about the tags, such as the source of an image or the target of a hyperlink.
